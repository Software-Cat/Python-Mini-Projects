5. Buddha Realm - 佛界

    The realm of buddism, created by the mind field of Buddha, the creator of buddhism. This realm is a great enemy of the demonic realm, restraining everything they do. This realm is as powerful as the gods.

6. Beast Realm - 兽/妖界

    The realm of beasts. In this realm, anything could become living. Then eventually take human form - This is just how the laws of the universe are set.

7. Goast Realm - 鬼界

    The realm of spirits. They don't have a body, they just have a soul. This realm is equally strong as the celestial realm. It is almost impossible for ghosts to fly up into the demonic realm.

8. Monster Realm - 怪界

    The realm of monsters. Brainless beings. They just fight and consume everything they encounter. Very few monsters evolve intellegence. Very very few could fly into the demonic realm.

9. Immortal Realm - 长生界

    The realm of immortals - Rulers of the universe. They aim to help the creator of the universe for minor tasks and management. They stand above all other realms, rarely doing anything personal. They are just rightious rulers. Here you find principle gods - Rulers of single laws. e.g. thunder, fire, water They are truely immortal, unless that law is wiped. You find secondary gods - Evolving rulers who will become principle gods in the future. Not immortal. You also find zenith gods - Gods infinitely close to becoming the creators of the universe. 

Each realm has it's own sub-owner, except for the immortal realm. The sub-owner of the immortal realm is the god/creator of the 9 realms. Each realm also has it's own realm spirit, they don't really appear to help the sub-owner unless the realm is in danger of being destroyed. 

The god of the 9 realms don't acutally handle all the laws of the universe. That's the job of people in the immortal realm. He doesn't need to practise magic either. He can make himself the best in one thought. There's no need ot practise. What he does instead is to try to lengthen his experinece of the world, something he has to learn for himself. What he normally does is to conceal his power and memory, then to reincarnate randomly. After millions of reincarnations, he would be able to gain a tiny spec of glimpse into the true next level in life. There must be a position higher than the god of the 9 realms.

Here, Darkon is a zenith god who became corrupt.

## Plot
Your father is actually the creator of the 9 realms. Your uncle is jealous of his power so he kills your father. At that time, the player cotrols a handsome man (the father), being defeated by a dark person surrounded by black stripes of energy(aka. Darkon). The trap disables your father's powers of creation. He was engulfed by a dark beam.  Nothing was left except ash after the beam ended. Your fatehr was gone. You don't know that the person killed was your father. Darkon was severly injured in that battle too to the point that he had to dorment. 

You, the protagonist wakes up. Thinking it was all a dream. Caused by the extreme emotional trauma caused by the mysterious disappearance of your father long ago. These dreams have been coming up more and more often. Now, you live with your uncle, facing problems of discrimination and mockery due to the lost of your father. But your uncle has always been nice to you. 

You sleep again. Dreaming that the hooded figure is severly injured by forcefully absorbing the power of creation. He shouts: "F**k! Why can't I absorb this power! The orgional owner is already dead!". Then the figure turns to look to the protagonist's direction, as if able to see through all of space and time, penetrating through the fake dream world, into your real self. You feel like you can't hide any secretes from him. The he quickly turns away. You are releaved that he is not acutally seeing you. He then says "Oh! I see! It's because the power's ownership is binded to his son! It's just waiting to be activated! The activation is split in to 9 fragments, guarded by powerful beasts. But I'm more powerful! Give me 1 century and I'll easily find all 9 keys and rightfully claim the ownership! The dream ends. 

You wake up the next day. On your way to school, you find a ring. You wear it. It was actually a magical ring. You use it to become very powerful. That day, you defeated all the bullies.

You go back to your house, not finding a good chance to tell your uncle about the magical ring. You go to sleep. You had another dream. It was about the figure seeing the 9 fragments and trying to grab one. A very powerful attack rises from the fragment and injures the figure. He exclaims: "S**t! Only the creator's son can take the fragment. The dream ends.

The mysterious figure appears in your house and grabs out a dagger and tried to stab you in your sleep. The dagger was magical, penetrating through all the defences your dad (you didn't know your dad was the creator of the 9 realms at this point) and the ring set on you. Even after the creator of the 9 realms is dead, his effects are still very powerful though. The crimson cloaked figure made furious grunts while stabbing through the protection. Your uncle rushes into your room, had a huge fight with the figure in another realm of space. You wake up. Uncle: "I'll explain later!". You controls the uncle as he fights the figure. Your uncle was powerful, he was winning big times. However, the figure suddenly starts burning. A dark rune appears in his chest. He explodes as all his energy was concentrated on to the dagger and the dagger was pointing at you. Your uncle used all his magical energy left to protect you. 

Your uncle feels he don't have long to live. His life was drained from the overload of magic. You can also see him aging at the speed of light, life slowly fading. So, he finally explains to you that your family is not a normal family. Your father was actually the creator of the universe. Somehow, one day he dreamed of a baby and a baby randomly appeared. That's you. Your uncle explains that when your dad went away, he was actually having a showdown with Darkon, the lord of darkness. Your father lost and was found no more, killed (Is he really dead? Who knows). But he also severly injured Darkon. 

The person that appeared earlier was a slave of Darkon. Yes, people can surrender their free will and enslave themselves to Darkon. You become very powerful if you do that, you just have to give up free will. Since you are the son of Darkon's arch nemisis, Darkon repeatedly wanted to kill you. Your uncle blocked all of them for you. Your uncle is your protector set by your father. Your father knew he might never return from the showdown with Darkon. Your father wanted you to live a peaceful life, not a violent one. He wanted your uncle to protect you forever and didn't want you to persuit the path as a world creator. However, Darkon seems to be recovering day by day. He can even create basic runes now. That rune earlier was by Darkon. It made your uncle ran out of magical energy, and life. He can't protect you anymore. So, now you must become a world creator or you'll be killed by Darkon.

You get the chance to explain your dreams and the ring to your uncle. He says the ring was created by your father, just in case you had to persuit the path as a world creator. He also says that the dream was a prophercy. There are indeed 9 realms in the universe, each probably matches with one fragment. He says he will use all his magic left to transform you into a new person. He will wipe your identity and change it to a new one. You will spawn in the mortal realm on a planet with basic magic. 

You feel a warm stream engulf you as your uncle turns into particles of light. You reincarnate.










When you finally collected the 9 fragments they magically piece together into a key. Your uncle suddenly appears and attacks you instantly. You are confused, you thought he was dead. While fighting, he explains his jealousy in you and how he enslaved himself to Darkon. But, you are powerful too, you had the power of your friends. When your uncle was on half a heart, he sacrafices himself to Darkon, "IF I CAN'T LIVE, THEN YOU CAN'T TOO!". Darkon's consciousness starts controlling your uncle. He becomes extremely powerful. You continue fighting. All of your friends made a sacrafice to you. The power of friendship glittered through your very soul. They combined with you to make a legendary final smash. Darkon also makes his final smash. 

"BOOM", all ended. It was time to see the final result. You are on 3 hearts, Darkon is on half a heart. The power of friendship is more powerful than Darkon. You hold the key and march to the obelisk of creation - the thing that will grant you the power of creation. You were about to insert the key. But you did not realise that behind you, Darkon used his last bit of energy to trigger a spell. Immense pain and torture immediately overwhelms you. Darkon laughs manically, and explains that in your reincarnation, your uncle planted a hidded spell in you. It was so powerful that even you didn't realise it. Darkon now triggered the spell and he can basically inflict pain over you whenever now. 

Darkon heals. Darkon threatens you to hand over the ownership of the key. You say no. The pain increases. Darkon marches around you and since you are going to die, tells the full story. 

It all started with a thought of jealousy. Your uncle was a strong zenith god. Until one day he became jealous of your father. Since he was a zenith god, he was powerful to immediately slice that thought out of his head. But the thought wasn't fully sliced. It grew and grew until it took over your uncle's body. That thought was Darkon. Darkon condensed his own body along with all your uncle's powers. 

Later he contaminates your uncle's origional thoughts with drops of evil. Now your uncle's origional body is a slave of darkon. Your father, the god of the 9 realms immediately found out after his reincarnation finished. Due to the inhumane ways Darkon use to gain energy, he became extremely powerful. Until the immortal realm wasn't enough to take care of him. Darkon tricks your father into a showdown with him. The spot was a trap. It blocked the powers of creation. Your father was killed. 

Speaking of that, Darkon rubs his sole onto your face as you lay helplessly on the floor. In too much agony to respond. "Lick it!" he commanded. "That'll show your dad how useless he is!". You refuse strongly. The pain increases. You cry out in pain. "Lick it!", Darkon presses his show against your chest. You refuse again. The pain increases again, but you were in too much misery to feel anything. But you were determined, you can't let your father, your friends, and the whole world down. The power of love shines through you. 

However, the world of love soon collapese into darkness. You were engulfed by a world of darkness and dread. It was Darkon's illusion. In the illusion, your mind was filled with uncertain thoughts: Do my dad really want me to become the god of teh 9 realms? He said I should just live a comfortable life. What is the point of becoming the god of the 9 realms? Should I just end this torture and give the key to Darkon? Would it be really boring being the god of the 9 realms? What is the point of being immortal? The longer you live, the longer you suffer, right? Your mind was stuck in an infinite whirlpool, unable to escape, falling into the deep dark torturous thoughts. 

Until, suddenly,
