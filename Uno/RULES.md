## **OBJECT**
The first player to play all of the cards in their hand in each round scores points for the cards their opponents are left holding. Normally, the first player to score 500 points wins the game. However, you can also choose whatever number of points required to win the game, as long as everyone agrees to it.


## **SETUP** 
Each player draws a card. Player with the highest point value is the dealer. Shuffle the deck. Each player is dealt 7 cards facing down.

Place the remaining cards facedown to form a DRAW pile. Turn over the top card of the DRAW pile to begin a DISCARD pile. If the top card is a Wild or Wild Draw 4, return it to the deck and pick another card. For all other cards, see directions that follow.


## **SPECIAL CARDS**
Besides the number cards, there are several other cards that help mix up the game. These special cards are called Action or Symbol cards.

**Draw 2 Card -** When you play this card, the next person to play must draw 2 cards and forfeit his/her turn. If this card is tured up at the beginning of play, the first player must draw two cards and forfeit his/her turn. This card may only be played on a matching color or on another Draw 2 card.

**Reverse Card -** This card reverses direction of play. Play to the left (clockwise) now passes to the right (counterclockwise), and vice versa. If this card is turned up at the beginning of play, count the number of people from the dealer to the original first player in the starting direction, then from the dealer, count the number counted in reversed direction. The player who got counted last now plays first, and play then goes to the reverded direction instead of the original direction. This card may only be played on a matching color or on another Reverse card.

**Skip Card -** The next person in line to play after this card is played loses his/her turn and is "skipped." If this card is turned up at the beginning of play, the first player is skipped. The next person in turn starts the game instead. This card may only be played on a matching color or on another Skip card.

**Wild Card -** When you play this card, you may change the color being played to any color (including the current color) to continue play. You may play a Wild card even if you have another playabe card in hand. If this card is turned up at the beginning of play, the person who plays first chooses the color to be played and plays the first card. This card may be played on any card.

**Wild Draw 4 Card -** This card allows you to call the next color played and requires the next player to pick 4 cards from the DRAW pile and forfeit his/her turn. However, there is a hitch! You can only play this card when you don't have a card in your hand that matches the color of the card previously played. If turned up at the beginning of play, return this card to the deck and pick anoter card. Note: A Player may play a "Wild Draw Four" card even if they have a matching numer or action card of a different color in their hand. If you suspect that a palyer has played a Wild Draw 4 card illegally, you may challenge them. A challenged player must show his/her hand to the player who challenged. If the challenged player is guilty, he/she must draw the 4 cards. IF the challenged player is not guilty, the challenger must draw the 4 cards, plus 2 additional cards. Only the person required to draw the 4 cards can make the challenge. If the this card is a turned up at the beginning of play, return it to the DRAW Pile, shuffle the deck, and turn over a new card.

**Blank Card (Customizable Card) -** This is a special card that you may use in one of two ways. If a card form your UNO deck is lost or damaged you may use the Black cCard as a replacement. Example: If you find that your deck is missing one of the yellow 7's you whoud simply replace it by taking the yellow Blank Card, marking a "7" on it and adding it back into the deck. If your family had a special UNO rule you prefer to play with, you may write that rule on the Blank Cards and add them straight to the deck. Before the game starts, make sure everyone agrees to the rules and also on how many of the Customisable cards will be used. You can use 0-4 of them per game. These cards are entirely customisable, you can choose their color, type and action. 
**A few wacky suggestions for customizable house rules (Do make up your own!):**
- The next player needs to do 3 sit-ups and if he/she fails or refuses, then draw 3 cards.
- The next player must sing a song, failing which, he/she needs to draw 2 cards.
- Everyone but you must draw 2 cards immediately.
- Everyone must immediately discard their Wild cards. Everyone but you.
- Call out the color you want. Then act or play a charade, and the first player who correctly guesses it can discard all the cards of that color that they have in hand at that moment.
- Everyone skips a turn, or rather, you take an extra turn.

**Wild Swap Hands Card -** This is a powerful card that enables you to swap the cards in your hand with anyone of your choice. Being a Wild card, it has the same attributes, namely, you can choose to either play it or not, at any of your turns, and also choose the color of play. Ideally, you would probably want to swap your cards with the player who has the least number of cards! Being a powerful Action card, only one is provided per deck. If turned up at the beginning of the game, the first player to start gets to choose the color and also swap his hands with another person. **What if your last card is a Wild Swap Hands?**
This scenario may happen from time to time. If your last card is a Wild Swap Hands card, you can treat it like a normal Wild card and play it to end the game right there and then – No further action is required. This is because you would obviously not win the game if you were required to swap your hand with another player.

### **GAMEPLAY** 
Player to the left of the dealer (you can also choose by your own method) normally plays first. Play passes to the left (clockwise direction) to start. Every player tries to match the top card on the DISCARD pile either by number, color or action. For example, if the card is a Green 7, you must play a Green card or any color 7. Or, you may play a Wild card or a Wild Draw 4 card (which can alter current color in play). 

If you don't have anything that matches or you choose not to play a playable card even though you have a match, you must draw a card from the DRAW pile. However, you may not play a card from your hand after the draw. If you draw a playable card, the card can be played. Otherwise, keep the card, and play moves to the next person in turn. You may choose to play a Wild card, or a Wild Draw 4 card on your turn too. 

Take note that you can only put down one card at a time and you cannot chain Draw cards of any type. You cannot stack two or more cards together on the same turn and you cannot place a Draw card on another Draw card to avoid drawing yourself. You must draw yourself and forfeit your turn. For example, you cannot put down a Draw Two on top of another Draw Two, or Wild Draw Four during the same turn, or put down two Wild Draw Four cards together. Also, you cannot place your Draw 2 card on top of a Draw 2 card to make the next person in turn draw 4 cards. You must draw the 2 cards yourself.

At any time during the game, if the DRAW pile becomes depleted and no one has yet won the round, reshuffle the DISCARD Pile and turn it over to regenerate a new DRAW pile.

Before playing your next-to-last card, you must say **"UNO"**. If you don't say UNO and another player catches you with just one card before the next player begins their turn you must pick FOUR more cards form the DRAW pile as a penalty. If you are not caught before the next player either draws a card form the DRAW plie or draws a card form their hand to play, you do not have to draw the extra cards. Assuming that the player is unable to play their last card and needs to draw, but after drawing, is then able to play that penultimate card, the player has to repeat the action of calling out “Uno”. The bottom line is – Announcing “Uno” needs to be repeated every time you are left with one card.

If you forgot to say, "UNO" before your card touches the DISCARD pile, but you "catch" yourself before any other player catches you, you are safe and not subject to the 4-card penalty. You may not catch a player for failure to say "UNO!" until his/her second-to-last card touches the DISCARD pile. Also, you may not catch a player for failure to say it after the next player begins his/her turn. "Beginning a turn" is defined as either drawing a card form the DRAW pile or drawing a card form your hand to play.

If the last card played in a hand is a Draw 2 card or Wild Draw 4 card, the next player must draw 2 or 4 cards, depending upon the card played. These cards are counted when points are totaled.

Once a player plays their last card, the hand is over. Points are tallied (see Scoring section) and you start over again.


## **SCORING**
If you are first to get rid of all your cards, you get points for the cards left in the other players hands. Use the included score pad to record your score after each hand. Each card is worth the following:

| Card Type                 | Worth                    |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------|
| All number cards (0-9)    | Face Value               |
| Draw 2                    | 20 Points                |
| Reverse                   | 20 Points                |
| Skip                      | 20 Points                |
| Wild                      | 50 Points                |
| Wild Draw 4               | 50 Points                |
| Blank                     | ?                        |

The WINNER is the first player to reach 500 points (or whatever number of points the players agree on). However, the game may be scored by keepign a running total of the points each palyer is caught with at the end of each hand. When one player reaches 500 points, the palyer with the lowest points is the winner.


## **TWO PLAYERS, PARTNERS AND MULTI-TABLE TOURNAMENTS**
**Rules for Two Players** - The following special rules apply to two-player UNO:

**1.** Playing a Reverse card works like playing a Skip card. By playing the Reverse card, you may immediately play another card.

**2.** By playing a Skip card, you may immediately play another card.

**3.** After playing a Draw 2 card or a Wild Draw 4 card, your opponent draws the number of cards indicated, and play is back to you.

**Partners: Four Players -** Sit across from your partner. When either partner goes out, the hand is over. Tatal all of the points in both opposing partners' hands and score for the winning team.

**Partners: Four Players Variation -** With four players, play four hands with each of the other three players as your partner (a total of 12 hands). Each player keeps track of his/her points scored in each partnership. Play several rounds, with the person scoring the highest number of points declared the winner.

**Partners: Eight Players -** Whith eight players, play two seperate games at two tables, with each player having every other player as a partner for four hands each (a total of 28 hands). Score as ablove.

## **CHALLENGE UNO** 
This alternative game rule is scored by keeping a running total of what each player is caught holding in his/her hand. As each player reaches a designated amount (500 is suggested), that player is eliminated from the game. When only two palyers are left in the game, they play head to head. (See Rules for Two Players above.) When a player reaches or exceeds the amount designated, they lose. The winner of that final hand is declared the winning player of the game. This variation is the most challenging to play.
