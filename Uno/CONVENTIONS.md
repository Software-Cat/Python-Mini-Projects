- Address cards like this: Wild card/s 

The card name is capitalised while the word card/s is lowercased. This is the case unless the card type is used as the heading for the explaination of that type of cards. In that case, do it like this: Wild Card

All Capitalised.

- use "-" instead of "1."

- if using a "-" or a ":" to give further information about the thing before the "-" or the ":", don't bold/italic/underline the "-" or ":". This is the case unless the information following the "-" or ":" is so long that it require a whole paragraphs. In that case, bold/italic/underline the "-" or ":" as well.

- Refer to the draw and discard pile like this: "DRAW pile", "DISCARD pile"

- Refer to numbers as numbers (e.g.4), not words (e.g.Four). This is unless it make a lot of sense to use words (which is normally not the case).
